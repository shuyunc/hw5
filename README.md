A mouse is hidden inside a hole, whenever you put a cheese near it, it will move closer to right, you need to use a mouse trap to catch it before it goes back to the hole. The mouse will show its tail randomly once when it comes out. Mouse is catched only when you press the T key and click on the mouse tail at the same time. If the mouse is catched, “You Win” will show on the screen.
